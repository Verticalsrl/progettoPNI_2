This is the table we will use to store all the historical edit information. In addition to all the fields from ebw_cavo, we add five more fields:*/CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ebw_cavo_history ( like ebw_cavo, created timestamp without time zone, created_by character varying(64), deleted timestamp without time zone, deleted_by character varying(64));GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, TRIGGER ON TABLE ebw_cavo_history TO operatore_r;--we import the current state of the active table into the history table, so we have a starting point to trace history from. Note that we fill in the creation time and creation user, but leave the deletion records NULL, but in case it exist already, I truncate it:TRUNCATE ebw_cavo_history;INSERT INTO ebw_cavo_history SELECT *, now(), current_user, null, null FROM ebw_cavo;--Now we need three triggers on the active table, for INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE actions. First we create the trigger functions, then bind them to the table as triggers.--For an insert, we just add a new record into the history table with the creation time/user:CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ebw_cavo_insert() RETURNS trigger AS$$  BEGIN    INSERT INTO schemaDB.ebw_cavo_history VALUES (NEW.*, current_timestamp, current_user, null, null);    RETURN NEW;  END;$$LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE TRIGGER ebw_cavo_insert_trigger AFTER INSERT ON ebw_cavo FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE ebw_cavo_insert();--For a deletion, we just mark the currently active history record (the one with a NULL deletion time) as deleted:CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ebw_cavo_delete() RETURNS trigger AS$$  BEGIN    UPDATE schemaDB.ebw_cavo_history      SET deleted = current_timestamp, deleted_by = current_user      WHERE deleted IS NULL and gidd = OLD.gidd;    RETURN NULL;  END;$$LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE TRIGGER ebw_cavo_delete_trigger AFTER DELETE ON ebw_cavo FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE ebw_cavo_delete();--For an update, we first mark the active history record as deleted, then insert a new record for the updated state:CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ebw_cavo_update() RETURNS trigger AS$$  BEGIN    UPDATE schemaDB.ebw_cavo_history      SET deleted = current_timestamp, deleted_by = current_user      WHERE deleted IS NULL and gidd = OLD.gidd;    INSERT INTO schemaDB.ebw_cavo_history    VALUES      (NEW.*, current_timestamp, current_user, null, null);    RETURN NEW;  END;$$LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE TRIGGER ebw_cavo_update_trigger AFTER UPDATE ON ebw_cavo FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE ebw_cavo_update();
